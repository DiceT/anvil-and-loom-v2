# Anvil & Loom: Feature Backlog & Inspiration

_Last updated: 2025-11-21_

## Purpose

Working list of features inspired by Obsidian, LegendKeeper, World Anvil, Kanka, Foundry VTT, and similar tools, evaluated as potential additions to **Anvil & Loom**.

We’ll expand and revise this file as we go.

---

## Architecture & Intent

Anvil & Loom treats a Tapestry as a world or campaign container, with structure and settings managed in Electron rather than as a bare folder on disk. Within a Tapestry, Entries are the primary surface for play and lore: Dice outcomes already log into Entries as collapsible Result Cards, and the same pattern will power future Table/Oracle results so play artifacts accumulate in-session.

The right tools pane (Dice today, Tables soon) and the tabbed center pane lay the groundwork for a Play Mode where a designated Session Entry stays active while Dice and Table tools stream Result Cards into it in real time. Aspects/Domains and Tables/Oracles (e.g., Haunted, Overgrown, Cemetery, Forest) are the engine for “discover what happens next,” and the existing tables directory plus table_creator tooling foreshadow those generators being wired into the UI like Dice is now.

The Dice pipeline (DiceExpression parser, DiceRoller, DiceBox adapter, rollHighlights, and the Result Card format in DiceTray) serves as a reference implementation for Tables: parse/generate, annotate, and render a standard Result Card with header, summary, and expandable meta. App.tsx’s state model (active Tapestry, open tabs, right-pane tools, IPC-backed persistence) already supports this event-log flow and will evolve by formalizing a “current Session Entry” and composing shared Result Card components for Dice and Tables, turning Entries into living play logs where dice, oracles, and world aspects drive emergent gameplay.


## Priority Legend

- **P0 – Core**: Must-have for the first public release.
- **P1 – High**: Strongly desired soon after core is stable.
- **P2 – Nice**: Quality-of-life or depth once the base is solid.
- **P3 – Future**: Experimental, stretch, or “only if it still feels right later”.

## 10. Open Questions & To-Discuss

A running list of things we want to argue about later:

- How deep should collaboration go in v1 vs focusing solely on solo GMs and authors?
- Where does Anvil & Loom stop being a “campaign manager” and start stepping on VTT territory?
- How opinionated should entity types be vs fully user-defined schemas?
- How tightly intertwined should maps, timelines, and oracles be in the first implementation?
