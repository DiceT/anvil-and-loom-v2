Every step may sink, suck, or slide, and water hides both hazards and long-rotting secrets. Light behaves badly here—muted, reflected, or swallowed by mist—and sound carries in strange ways across reeds and pools. In a Mire, movement is slow, landmarks are deceptive, and anything abandoned tends to stay that way until someone is unlucky enough to find it again.",

Every step may sink, suck, or slide, and water hides both hazards and long-rotting secrets. Light behaves badly here—muted, reflected, or swallowed by mist—and sound carries in strange ways across reeds and pools. In a Mire, movement is slow, landmarks are deceptive, and anything abandoned tends to stay that way until someone is unlucky enough to find it again.",
